This example redirects to `www.example.com`. It will forward any url path
provided, however it will not currently forward a querystring if it exists. Feel
free to clone this repository. If you enable the GitHub/Zeit integration, then
the redirect will be aliases automatically. This example would redirect
`example.com` -> `www.example.com`. Make sure to have at least one other static file in the repository (such as an empty `index.html` or `README.md`)
